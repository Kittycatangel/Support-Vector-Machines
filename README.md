# Support-Vector-Machines

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm and is very popular among data scientists.
The main idea behind SVM is to draw a line between two or more classes in the best possible manner. Once the line is drawn to separate the classes, you can then use it to predict future data. The goal is to find the largest possible width for the margin that can separate the two groups. The center of the margin is called a hyperplane.
The hyperplane is the line separating the two groups of points. We use the term “hyperplane” instead of “line” because in SVM we typically deal with more than two dimensions, and using the word “hyperplane” more accurately conveys the idea of a plane in a multidimensional space.
